# WDI 34 Project 1 Presentation Guidelines


### Timing

At the time presentations are scheduled to begin, be in the room and ready to present your project!

Your presentation should be 8-10 minutes (2 person teams).  **Each developer MUST present for an equal time during your presentation.**  There will also be a few minutes of questions and answers after each presentation.


### Content

The presentation should include:

- Names of each team member
- Motivation for the project
- Demo 
- A snippet (about 3-5 lines) that each of you would like to share, and why it's interesting or why you're proud of it

Also, as you're telling us about the demo or snippets, include:

- Triumphs (1-2 things you're most excited about)
- Challenges (1-2 things that were most difficult, whether they're finished or not) 



### Presentation Tips
- Consider what you want to show to your audience; don't "wing it."

- Copy your code snippets and explanation into your readme and/or slides.

- Zoom your browser window to 150%.

- If showing your text editor, zoom in on your text editor or set font size to at least 20px.

- Speak loudly enough so the people in the back of the room can hear you!
